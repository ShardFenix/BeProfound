# How to Appear Profound to Other Retards
Are you a retard? You probably wouldn't know if you were, because you're retarded. Here's an easy test: Do you think you're really smart, but have never done anything useful or difficult in your life? Chances are, this applies to you. Don't fret (fret means 'worry'), for even YOU can make other retards believe that you have some semblance of cleverness.

### YouTube Comments
One way to appear profound or clever to other retards on YouTube is to put something basic in the comments. If you're watching a movie, skit, or other type of show that is quotable, just make a comment containing a random quote from the video. Don't bother throwing any original thoughts into your comment. Originality is for losers with talent. And whatever you do, DON'T explain your comment or how it will ever be anything other than a waste of everyone else's time to read. If people don't instantly understand why you made such a basic, useless comment, they shouldn't be watching YouTube.

### Argue with people, but ignore everything they say
A great way to appear like you know what you're talking about is to challenge people to an argument, when you yourself don't know what an argument is or how to support it with evidence and facts. Your opponent can't win an argument you don't have. Checkmate, Atheists! Remember, the key to looking smart in front of other retards is to cram as many logical fallacies into your "argument" as possible.

It's obligatory (that means required) to say "Your dumb", spelled exactly that way. Other retards will rally behind you like you're the babboon with the most colorful butt. Meanwhile you will bring joy to your opponent who appreciates the irony of you misspelling one of the most common words in your primary language.

Whenever your opponent presents facts that disprove your claims, never change your mind. Having your mind changed by evidence is called "learning", but you're a retard who is incapable of this. Instead, call your opponent a dumb kid or say something about their mom. It's always super effective, especially in the 90s. Being obstinate (that means stubborn) is how Einstein became famous, and you are literally Einstein.

If your opponent asks you a question, chances are he's using the socratic method to get you to admit how idiotic your own argument is. This is something only clever people do, so don't fall for it! Refuse to answer anyone else's questions. Admitting you're wrong is scary! It feels much better to just believe whatever stupid shit pops into your mind or is fed to you by your retarded friends on social media. As everybody knows, feelings are more important than reality. If they weren't, religion wouldn't exist. Religion exists, therefore facts don't matter.

### Quote Bad Sources, Ad Populum
A great way to show off your mental acuity (that means sharpness) is to quote nonauthoratative sources and claim that it's meaningful. Common examples are:
```
"I heard on Fox News that..."
"I saw an article on Medium saying..."
"<insert famous social media retard here> said..."
```
As long as you list a source, no matter how worthless it is, other retards will think you've done research. As everyone knows, doing research makes you right, because everything on the internet is true. Also, if someone is really popular, that means they must be a perfect person who's always right. You know, like Hitler.
