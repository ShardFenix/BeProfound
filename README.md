# How to Appear Profound to Other Retards
Are you a retard? You probably wouldn't know if you were, because you're retarded. Here's an easy test: Do you think you're really smart, but have never done anything useful or difficult in your life? Chances are, this applies to you. Don't fret (fret means 'worry'), for even YOU can make other retards believe that you have some semblance of cleverness.

### YouTube Comments
One way to appear profound or clever to other retards on YouTube is to put something basic in the comments. If you're watching a movie, skit, or other type of show that is quotable, just make a comment containing a random quote from the video. Don't bother throwing any original thoughts into your comment. Originality is for losers with talent. And whatever you do, DON'T explain your comment or how it will ever be anything other than a waste of everyone else's time to read. If people don't instantly understand why you made such a basic, useless comment, they shouldn't be watching YouTube.

### Argue with people, but ignore everything they say
A great way to appear like you know what you're talking about is to challenge people to an argument, when you yourself don't know what an argument is or how to support it with evidence and facts. Your opponent can't win an argument you don't have. Checkmate, Atheists! Remember, the key to looking smart in front of other retards is to cram as many logical fallacies into your "argument" as possible.
